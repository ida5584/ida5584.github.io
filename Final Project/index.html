            <h1>Overview Of The Game</h1>
            <p style="line-height:2em;">
                Werewolf Killing is a multiplayer strategy board game driven by verbal description, contesting 
                eloquence and analytical judgment. The usual version of the game requires 9 players and a 
                narrator to participate in the interaction. Out of the 9 players, 3 will belong in the werewolf 
                group and 6 in the good group. There is a majority of players in the good group but they donâ€™t 
                know their team members. The main methods of eliminating players are voting to exile and character 
                skills.
