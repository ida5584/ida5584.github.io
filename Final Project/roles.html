                        <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 15px;"> You reside on the good side, in the Special’s faction. You wake up right after 
                            the Wolves. You have one antidote to save one player and one poison to kill one 
                            player. The narrator will tell you which player has died so long as you still have 
                            the antidote.

                        and the Mage. You may investigate one player during the night and will receive information 
                        on whether the player is good or bad but not what faction the player is in.

                        so the narrator can confirm your role. You do nothing during the night. When your death 
                        is announced, you may activate your skill and choose a player to shoot.</p>
